### ‚úèÔ∏è Create a offline install media (Optional)
In case of reinstalling macOS, a offline install media can save some time. You also don't need an Ethernet connection for the installation.
To create a offline install media, you need the following stuff: 

- macOS Installer from the App Store.
- A 16 GB pendrive (Keep in mind, during the preperation we will format the disk to create the install media).

Press `ALT + SPACE` and open Disk utility. Select your USB device and click erase. Name it `MyUSB` and choose **Mac OS Extended** with **GUID Partition Map**. After erasing the USB device, close Disk utility.

Now press `ALT + SPACE` and open terminal. Type the following command:

Big Sur:
```sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Big\ Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSB --downloadassets```

Monterey:
```sudo /Applications/Install\ macOS\ Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia --volume /Volumes/MyUSB --downloadassets```

After creating the install media, copy your EFI folder to the EFI partition of your USB device.
